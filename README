Description: These files perform a cost optimization algorithm implementing a batch gradiant descent algorithm, displaying the different regression lines
error loss function, R^2 values, and RMSE values as plots & text outputs for some.

File Manifest:
    albacore_metal.dat
    dip-har-eff.csv
    drift-har-eff.csv
    set-har-eff.csv
    setNet.py
    dipNet.py
    driftNet.py
    metalModel.py
    and this README.txt

The different file names are configured to run with their corresponding data files:
    dipNet.py -> dip-har-eff.csv
    driftNet.py -> drift-har-eff.csv
    setNet.py -> set-har-eff.csv
    metalModel.py -> albacore_metal.dat

Each of these files are configured to be runnable by any Python environment. Written in Pycharm-Community_Edition, each file contains an output consisting of:
    plots
    terminal text outputs

USE OF FILES:
    Run the file you would like (ex. 'dipNet.py') -> output appears on screen both as plots & in environment's terminal. There is no input needed from the user
    besides running the runnable files (marked with a filetype of .py).

TROUBLESHOOTING:
    If you receive an error while running these files, make sure first that your environment has the following imports for:
        matplotlib -> 'pip install matplotlib'
        numpy -> 'pip install numpy'
        pandas -> 'pip install pandas'

    If the runnable file doesn't configure, a suggestion would be to install and run on PyCharm's community environment (free to signup and install).
           Make sure to configure with a Python interpreter.
